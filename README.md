# Harmonic_Oscillator_Vmc
Variational monte carlo estimation for the ground state of the simple 1D harmonic oscillator.

The goal of this project is to compute the upper bound for the ground state of the simple harmonic oscillator using monte carlo integration tecniques and the metropolis algoritm to sample from a general pdf.

# Installation
The code requires two python libreries: numpy and matplotlib. If not already preset in the programming environment they require an installation. In order to import the libreries it is sufficient to write in the kernel the following commands:
1. pip install numpy
2. pip install matplotlib
